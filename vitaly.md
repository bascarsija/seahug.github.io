# The Glasgow Haskell Compiler as an exercise in the type theory

* Location: [Indeed, Inc., Russell office, 1301 2nd Avenue, 13th floor, Seattle, WA 98101][location]
* Time: Thursday 27 September 2018 from 6pm to 8:30pm (PDT), presentation to start at 6:30pm

## Presenter

Vitaly Bragilevsky is a university lecturer in Computer Science, author of ["Haskell in Depth"][haskell-in-depth], Haskell language committee member (Haskell 2020), invited lecturer at LambdaConf etc.

## Overview

The Glasgow Haskell Compiler uses quite advanced type theory in its implementation. In this talk, I'll give a shallow introduction to both type theory and the compiler and show how they work together to produce programs in Haskell. The knowledge of type theory is not required to attend this talk. The knowledge of Haskell at the beginner's level is useful but is not required either, although functional programming background is essential.

## Q&A

**Q: Will you have food?**
