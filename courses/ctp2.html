<p><strong>This is a 10-week in-person course taking place in Seattle, WA, United
States.</strong>
</p>
<p>This class will follow and expand upon Bartosz Milewski's
<a href="https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/">blog.</a>
There will be lots of diagrams and programming on the whiteboard!</p>
<p>In Bartosz's own words:</p>
<blockquote>I got the crazy idea, around 2014, to write a book about category theory for
programmers. Mind you, not computer scientists but
programmers&mdash;engineers rather than scientists. The idea evolved into a
blog, and now into a course. I can't deny that there is a huge gap between
science and engineering, because I have worked on both sides of the divide.
But I've always felt a very strong compulsion to explain things. I have
tremendous admiration for Richard Feynman who was the master of simple
explanations. I know I'm no Feynman, but I will try my best.</blockquote>
<p>To follow the course you don't need to know a lot of computer science or
mathematics but you will need to be an experienced programmer. You should
know what generic programming and polymorphism are.</p>
