## Announcements

On Thursday 27 September 2018, [Vitaly Bragilevsky][vitaly], author of ["Haskell in Depth"][haskell-in-depth], will present a talk entitled ["The Glasgow Haskell Compiler as an exercise in the type theory"][vitaly] at Indeed, Inc. in Seattle.

On Thursday, July 19th we welcomed Bartosz Milewski back for a
third series of lectures on Category Theory. You can find links to his earlier lectures in our [courses section][courses]. These lectures are also being recorded. RSVP at [Meetup.com][category-theory].

On April 4th, SeaHUG started a study group for anyone interested
in learning the foundations of practical Haskell. We are halfway through this series; you can read about what
we covered [here][april-minutes].
