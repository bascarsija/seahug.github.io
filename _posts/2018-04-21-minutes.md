### Presentations

* A presentation on Miso: Dave's pentominoes implementation using Miso&mdash;"a tasty Haskell front-end framework"
  * [Dave Compton][dave-compton-github] presenting
  * Dave will talk about [Miso][miso] using his [Pentominoes][pentominoes-github] puzzle as a case study (see [Wikipedia article][pentominoes-wikipedia])
  * An "exact cover" problem in mathematics
  * A recursive solution, identifying the most constraining edge of the board at each pass
  * Solution builds a tree and then destroys it
  * Equivalent to anamorphism and catamorphism composed together, i.e. a hylomorphism
  * In other words, use a tree as a constraining structure, but no need to build the whole thing in memory
* [David Johnson][dmjio], creator of Miso, will be in attendance and will chat about Miso too
  * Miso Philosophy
  * Keep it simple
    * Avoid unnecessary dependencies
    * Keep the view pure: the second you add Ajax calls to the view is the moment you lose composability of your application
  * Implemetation
  * Diff
    * Diff is done in JavaScript
    * Not in Haskell, for various reasons
    * Among them is the nontrivial nature of profiling GHC to eke out more performance
    * React uses a two-pass approach: it first calculates patches and on the second pass applies them
    * Miso uses a single pass approach, influenced by [Bobril][bobril] (developed by [Boris Letocha][boris-letocha])
  * Event handling
    * Other frameworks have an impure approach, adding event listeners to specific elements in the document body as needed
    * This can (and has) run up against browser limitations
    * Using event bubbling, you can have just one listener on the body to handle all events
    * For each event Miso strips extraneous data and produces a JSON object, which can then be passed purely to Haskell
    * Instead of event listeners, use immutable pointers&mdash;essentially stacks which define the DOM location of the event's element
