In June, Sebastien Guillemot presented IOHK's spec for a cryptocurrency wallet and Bartosz Milewski talked about linear types

<!--more-->

### Agenda

* "Modelling a wallet in Haskell" by [Sebastien Guillemot][sebastien-guillemot]
  * IOHK released a formal specification of a wallet back in May and they continue to work to both improve this document and implement it in Haskell.
  * In this talk I will cover the mathematical considerations as laid out in the spec along with how it is implemented in Haskell.
  * This talk requires a beginner's understanding of blockchain but is more of a math/Haskell talk than a blockchain talk.
  * This talk is independent from IOHK. Any and all opinions are my own.
* Linear types
  * [Bartosz][bartosz-milewski] presented linear types

### Attendance

There were 16 Haskellers in attendance!
