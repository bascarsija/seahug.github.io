At May's meeting, Bartosz gave a presentation about the ST monad and we took
part in a related live-coding session

<!--more-->

### Notes

* Bartosz talked about the [ST monad][st-monad]
* Michael led a live-coding session in which we implemented [`State`][state],
  [`StateT`][statet] and [`ST`][st-monad] from scratch
* Richard complained that there are two many things in Haskell with "state" in
  their names

### Attendance

* We had about twenty attendees
* And a couple of noobs!
